# Soil-Type-Classification-Using-Combined-CNN-and-SVM
A Combined CNN–SVM soil classification system that identifies Alluvial, Black, Clay, and Red soils from images. The system preprocesses soil images, extracts features using CNN, classifies soil types with SVM, evaluates model performance, and provides a Flask web interface for real-time prediction.
